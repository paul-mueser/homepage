        This is a basic Discord music bot that can play music from YouTube and other sources. It has the basic functionality
        of a music bot.
        It is more of a fun project for me, so I am currently not planning on adding much more features, however I am open
        to suggestions
        and might add more features in the future.

        The bot is written in JavaScript and uses the discord.js and discord-player library. It can either be run using
        Node.js or as a Docker container.
