        <h1>My Homepage</h1>
        <p>
            This is my personal homepage. It is a simple Vue.js application that I use to provide some information about me and to showcase my projects.
            It is a fun project for me and I am adding new features to it from time to time. I don't have much experience with web development, so I am
            learning a lot while working on this project and trying out a bunch of new things.
        </p>
        <p>
            The homepage is written in JavaScript and uses the Vue.js framework.
